Site Blocker Privacy policy
Last updated: June 11, 2025

1. What Information Does 'Site Blocker' Collect?    
    The Extension is designed to help you block unwanted websites.To achieve this, 
    it collects the following types of information:
        > URLs of Visited Pages (Accessed Temporarily):
            When you choose to activate the blocking feature (e.g., by clicking the 
            extension icon or using a context menu option),the Extension accesses 
            the URL of the currently active web page.This is necessary for you to 
            select and add that specific page to your blocked list. This URL is accessed
            only at the moment of your interaction and is not stored unless you explicitly
            add it to your blocked list.
            Every time you attempt to visit a new web page, the Extension accesses the URL
            of that page. This is necessary for the Extension to check if the URL is 
            present in your personal blocked list. If the URL matches an entry in your blocked
            list, the Extension will prevent the page from loading

        > Your Blocked List:
            The Extension stores a list of the URLs that you have explicitly chosen to block. 
            This list is entirely user-defined and managed directly by you.

2. Why Does 'Site Blocker' Collect This Information?
    The information described above is collected solely for the following purposes, which 
    are integral to the Extension's functionality:
        > To enable the core feature of the Extension, allowing you to designate specific 
          web pages for blocking.
        > To maintain and enforce your personal list of blocked websites, preventing your
          browser from loading them according to your preferences.

3. How Is Your Information Used and Stored?
    > Local Storage Only:
        All data collected by 'Site Blocker', including your list of blocked URLs, is stored
        locally on your device within your browser's local storage (using the Chrome Storage API).
    > No Transmission to Servers:
        The Extension does NOT transmit, share, or store your URLs, your blocked list, or any 
        other collected data to our servers,any third-party servers, or any external entities.
        Your data remains entirely on your local computer.
    > No Personally Identifiable Information:
        This Extension does NOT collect any personally identifiable information (such as your 
        name, email address, physical address, age, health information, financial information, or
        personal communications).
    > No Tracking of General Browse:
        The Extension does NOT track your general Browse history, mouse movements, keystrokes,
        or any user activity beyond the explicit interactions you have with the Extension's 
        features (e.g., clicks on the extension icon to add a URL to the blocked list).
    > Open Source Transparency:
        As an open-source project, the source code for 'Site Blocker' is publicly available 
        at https://github.com/seriousadi/site-blocker.This allows anyone to inspect the code 
        and verify its data handling practices.

4. How Can You Manage Your Data?
    Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it:
        > Managing Your Blocked List:
            You can view, add, or remove URLs from your blocked list directly within the 
            Extension's options or settings.
        > Deleting All Data:
            Uninstalling the Extension from your browser will automatically remove all data
            stored locally by the Extension, including your entire blocked list.
